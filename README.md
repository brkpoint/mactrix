## About
Cool looking matrix effect in the terminal or something...

(simple project)

## WARNING!
It could not work on mac's default terminal (idk how to set 256 bit colors on it) so if you want to see colors you should use a diffrent terminal (I recomend using iTerm).

## Compiling:
Compile with -O3 flag (faster program)

## Usage:
Quit by clicking any button.
