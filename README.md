# mactrix
## About
Cool looking matrix effect in the terminal or something...

(simple project)

## WARNING!
It could not work on mac's default terminal (idk how to set 256 bit colors on it) so if you want to see colors you should use a diffrent terminal (I recomend using iTerm).

## Compiling:
Compile with -O3 flag (faster program)
```zsh
g++ main.cpp -O3 -o mactrix
```

## Adding it as a global command:
First go to:
```
/usr/local/bin
```
then put the compiled bin into this folder. And voil√†, you can now use mactrix in any path!

## Usage:
Quit by clicking 'q'.
